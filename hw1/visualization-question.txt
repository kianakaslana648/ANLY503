Is there any difference of min balances and max balances among accounts with
different number of customers?

We can use boxplot to clearly show the overall distribution since the range of numbers
of customers is 0-2.

Result: There is little difference between one-customer account and two-customer account.
But there is strong difference between zero-customer account and the other two kinds.

I think the accounts with zero-customer are the special accounts opened for corporations or some
institutions. Thus, the behavior of the balance is quite different.
